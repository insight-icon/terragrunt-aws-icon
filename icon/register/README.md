# terraform-aws-icon-preptools-s3

This module helps with registering a node on the ICON Blockchain. It does three main things. 

- Creates an elastic IP that will be your main IP that your node will use to run 
- Puts the necessary details.json file in a bucket publicly accessible 
- Outputs the commands you need to run in preptools 

**Make sure you have 2000 ICX registration fee in your wallet for mainnet and you have testnet tokens for testnet** 

Future versions will run preptools automatically and will be idempotent (ie can run as many times as you want without breaking things). 

## Using this module 

Fill out the appropriate values in `terragrunt.hcl`. Few notes, 

```hcl
// This MUST be set right from the get go. Options are `mainnet` or `testnet` 
//  If you do this wrong for main, you will have to switch wallet most likely (untested)
network_name = "testnet"

// If you leave these commented out, you will be prompted for password each time
// If you run this module directly, (terragrunt apply), fill it out like this to prevent password from hitting disk 
  keystore_password = ""
//keystore_password = local.secrets["keystore_password"]
``` 

You never want to destroy the IP that you use to register so feel free to modify the lines below. 

**From** 
```hcl
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = false
  }
```

**To** 
```hcl
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true 
  }
```

EIPs are not covered under the free plan and cost money when they are not in use.  To destroy the EIP after you set the `prevent_destroy` protection, you have to reapply the module with the `prevent_destroy` set to false. 

#### Running the module 
To run the module run this within this directory:

```bash
terragrunt apply
```

#### Registering the node 
The output of the module will contain lines similar to this. 

**Test Net**
```bash
preptools registerPRep \
> --url https://zicon.net.solidwallet.io \
> --nid 2 \
> --keystore /c/Users/rob/PycharmProjects/blockchain/icon/registration/InsightTN4C4/keystore \
> --name "Insight-C2" \
> --country "USA" \
> --city "San Francisco" \
> --email "insight.icon.prep@gmail.com" \
> --website "insight-icon.net" \
> --details http://prep-registration-upright-molly.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/details.json \
> --p2p-endpoint "3.229.229.89:7100"
```

Copy and paste these lines into your terminal to register your node. 

## TTD 

- Have preptools register automatically within the module 
	- There is an error with the registration process 
- Put an object in S3 that qualifies whether `preptools registerPRep` has run already in which case all future commands are `preprools setPRep` to update documents.
